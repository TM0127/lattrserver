                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

# 한국어

Rhymix(라이믹스)는 누구든지 쉽고 자유롭게 독립적인 홈페이지를 만들어
자신을 표현하고 커뮤니티를 키워나갈 수 있도록 돕기 위한 CMS(content management system)입니다.

[XpressEngine](https://xe1.xpressengine.com) 1.8 버전을 fork(가지치기)하여 진행하는 프로젝트로,
누구나 무료로 사용할 수 있고 개발에 참여할 수도 있는 자유 소프트웨어(free software)입니다.

Rhymix는 "시를 짓다, 운을 맞추다"라는 의미의 "rhyme"과
"조합하다, 변주하다"라는 의미의 "remix"를 합친 이름입니다.
라이믹스는 인터넷 공간에서 자유롭게 창작 활동을 하고
다양한 소프트웨어와 콘텐츠를 조합하여 새로운 것을 만들어내는 모든 사용자들을 응원합니다.

### 개발 방향

Rhymix는 개발자와 사용자가 서로의 권리와 책임을 존중하는 인터넷 생태계,
중앙집중형 SNS 플랫폼에 의존하지 않고도 누구나 내 목소리를 낼 수 있는 세상,
벤처기업이나 스타트업의 개발자들뿐 아니라 평범한 블로거, 동호회, 학생, 장애인 등도
사이버 공간에 당당하게 집을 짓고 서로 소통할 수 있는 미래를 만들어가길 원합니다.

개발자 위주, 서비스 제공자 위주로 나아가는 현대의 IT 동향을 무차별적으로 받아들이기보다는
사용자의 주권과 열린 인터넷 환경을 보호하는 기술을 집중적으로 발굴하며,
우리나라 인터넷 커뮤니티의 성장을 이끌었던 90년대 제로보드와 2000년대 XE의 정신을 이어받아
2020년대 현재 위기에 처한 오픈 웹을 지키고 회복시키는 일에 앞장서고자 합니다.

그러기 위해서는 다른 어떤 CMS보다도 일반 사용자를 위한 편리성이 가장 뛰어나야 합니다.

- 초보자도 쉽게 클릭 몇 번으로 웹사이트를 완성할 수 있을 만큼 편리한 CMS
- 최신 기술을 적극적으로 사용하고 속도가 빠르며 보안이 우수한 CMS
- 커뮤니티를 통해 사용자와 개발자의 건전한 의사소통을 돕는 CMS
- 애드온, 모듈, 위젯 등 기존 XE 서드파티 자료들과의 호환성을 최대한 보장하려고 노력합니다.

### 설치 환경

Rhymix를 사용하려면 PHP 7.0 이상, MySQL 5.0.7 이상 버전이 필요합니다.
자세한 설치 환경은 [매뉴얼](https://rhymix.org/manual/introduction/requirements)을 참고하십시오.

### 개발 참여

Rhymix는 개발자, 디자이너, 번역가 등의 도움과 일반 사용자들의 버그 신고를 환영합니다.
참여를 원하시는 분은 질서있고 효율적인 프로젝트 운영을 위해
[이슈 및 PR 작성 방법](https://rhymix.org/manual/contrib/github)과
[코딩 규칙](https://rhymix.org/manual/contrib/coding-standards)을 먼저 읽어 주시기 바랍니다.

보안 취약점을 발견하셨다면 해커들에게 알려지기 전에 먼저 패치를 작성할 수 있도록
devops@rhymix.org로 알려 주시면 감사하겠습니다.

### 공식 홈페이지

- Rhymix : https://rhymix.org

### 커뮤니티

- XETOWN : https://xetown.com

### 저작권 및 라이선스

Rhymix는 [GNU GPL v2](http://korea.gnu.org/documents/copyleft/gpl.ko.html)
또는 그 이후 버전 라이선스의 적용을 받는 자유 소프트웨어(free software)입니다.
자유 소프트웨어는 "오픈소스" 또는 "개방형"이라는 명칭으로도 알려져 있으며,
개발자와 사용자의 자유와 권리, 참여와 책임을 강조하는 프로그램으로
누구나 무료로 사용할 수 있고 개발에 참여할 수도 있습니다.

Rhymix는 [NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/)가 일부 저작권을 가진
[XpressEngine](https://xe1.xpressengine.com)의 소스코드에 바탕을 두고 있습니다.
Rhymix 개발자들이 추가 및 변경한 부분의 저작권은 해당 개발자들에게 있습니다.

XpressEngine은 초창기에 GPL을 사용하다가 버전 1.4.0부터 LGPL로 전환했지만,
Rhymix는 사용자의 권리를 더욱 보호하고 자유 소프트웨어 본연의 정신에 충실하기 위해 라이선스를 GPL로 되돌렸습니다.
(라이선스 전환은 [LGPL v2.1 제3조](http://korea.gnu.org/documents/copyleft/lgpl.ko.html#term3)에서 허용하고 있습니다.)

GPL은 WordPress, Drupal, Joomla 등 세계적인 CMS들이 공통으로 채택하고 있는 라이선스이므로
사용자 및 개발자의 권리와 의무도 이러한 CMS들의 경우와 동일합니다.

홈페이지에 Rhymix를 사용하는 것만으로 소스코드를 공개할 의무가 발생하지는 않으며,
Rhymix의 소스코드를 수정하거나 확장 기능을 직접 개발하여 사용하더라도 마찬가지입니다.
그러나 직접 개발한 확장 기능을 제3자에게 배포 또는 판매할 경우에는 반드시 소스코드를 제공해야 하며,
이러한 소스코드는 모두 GPL 라이선스의 적용을 받습니다.

# English

Rhymix is a content management system (CMS) for everyone who wants to create independent homepages to express themselves and build their communities easily and freely.

Rhymix is a fork of [XpressEngine](https://xe1.xpressengine.com) version 1.8 and is free software that anyone can use for free and participate.

Rhymix is a combination of "rhyme" in the sense of "making a poem, adjusting the sound", and "remix" in the sense of "combining, changing".
Rhymix cheers everyone who freely creates and/or assembles new things in the Internet space by combining various software and contents.

### Development Direction

Rhymix developers want an Internet ecosystem where developers and users respect each other's rights and responsibilities, 
a world where everyone can speak their voice without relying on a centralized SNS platform, 
a future where ordinary bloggers, students, the disabled and others as well as developers of startups can build a home in cyberspace and communicate with each other.

Rather than indiscriminately accepting modern IT trends that are centered on developers and service providers, 
we focused on technologies that protect users' sovereignty and open Internet environment. Taking the spirit of ZeroBoard and XpressEngine, which led the growth of the Korean Internet communities in the 1990s and 2000s respectively, Rhymix wants to take the lead in recovering and restoring the open web in the crisis of the 2020s.

This requires the most convenience for the average user over any other CMS.

- CMS that is convenient enough to create the website easily, even for beginners, with a few clicks
- CMS that is actively using the latest technology, fast and secure
- CMS to help users and developers communicate well through community
- We try to ensure maximum compatibility with existing XpressEngine third-party materials such as add-ons, modules and widgets.

### Installation Environment

Rhymix requires PHP 7.0 or higher, and MySQL 5.0.7 or higher.
Please see the [online manual](https://rhymix.org/manual/introduction/requirements) for more information on server requirements.

### Participation in Development

Rhymix welcomes developers, designers, translators, and bugs to the public.
If you would like to participate, please read [Issue and PR Submission Guide](https://rhymix.org/manual/contrib/github)
and [Coding Standards](https://rhymix.org/manual/contrib/coding-standards) first to ensure efficient and orderly project management.

If you have found a security vulnerability, please let us know at devops@rhymix.org so that we can make a patch before it is exploited.

### Copyright and License

Rhymix is a free software licensed under the [GNU GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later.
Free software is a program that emphasizes the rights and responsibilities of developers and users to participate or use in freedom.

Rhymix is based on the source code of [XpressEngine](https://xe1.xpressengine.com) ([Github](https://github.com/xpressengine/xe-core/)), which is free software partly owned by [NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/).
Rhymix developers have copyrights on the added and modified code.

XpressEngine has been licensed under the GPL in its early days and switched to LGPL from version 1.4.0, but Rhymix has reverted its licenses to the GPL for further protection of the rights and spirit of free software.
(License conversion is allowed in [LGPL v2.1 Section 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).)

The GPL is commonly adopted by global CMSes such as WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla. The rights and obligations of users and developers of Rhymix are the same as those CMSes.

The use of Rhymix on homepage does not impose a duty on you to release the source code, even if you modify the source code or develop the extension yourself.
However, distributing and/or selling the source code or extension according to the GPL license, you have to provide the source code.


Security Policy
---------------

### Supported Versions

Only the latest version is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report possible vulnerabilities by email to devops@rhymix.org.
Please DO NOT use GitHub issues or pull requests for this purpose.

We do not consider it a vulnerability if the superuser (is_admin=Y) account
can insert scripts or delete information. That's what the superuser account is for!
It will, however, be considered a serious vulnerability if someone else can
trick a superuser to perform such actions inadvertently,
for example through a CSRF attack.
